##About Roller

*In the beginning, there were images. Then, the animated gif. And full-length video clips. And now, there is Roller.*

**What is it?** Roller is an online sidekick that helps you collect, share and save your favorite multimedia moments from YouTube. Roller allows you to easily isolate specific bits of videos - just the part you want to see - and then send the snippet as a short link to your friends while preserving the element of surprise (by hiding every YouTube detail except the video itself). Everything you share can be saved on Roller for easy access and future use.

**Why did we build this?** The big problem with trying to clown or surprise someone with youtube links is that the humor is compromised when one’s video slowly buffers with it’s title and description in full view. That’s why roller links presents the clip and nothing more - no distracting titles and related video info. Just the very moment you wish to communicate with a friend or internet friend.

**When would I use it?**

- You want to create a multimedia “reaction image” - a link that jumps right to a reactive moment in a video

- You want to share a funny moment or punchline from a long comedy skit or routine
- There’s a musical phrase you want to point out in a full performance or concert
- ...More to be determined by you, dear user

**Who are we?** A couple of trolls who want to leverage the power of the web and the content of YouTube to share multimedia just the way we like it. Whether it’s for preserving our best memories or amusing our friends, we want to up the ante in this game of link-sharing and go a step beyond the .jpg & .gif.
